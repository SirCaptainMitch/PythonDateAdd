# PythonDateAdd

Adds the functionality of the T-SQL DATEADD function to python making use of datetime, calendar and timedelta. 

I was writing a script to check file created dates and noticed that it was rather tedius to add or subtract a number to a date. However it was rather easy to accomplish this in SQL. So I figured why not build it? 

As of right now it will do Years, Days and Months. I plan to add Weeks, Hours, Minutes, Seconds, and Milliseconds.

You can see examples in testing.py.
